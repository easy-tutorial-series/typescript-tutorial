# TypeScript Tutorial

This is a easy but sufficient tutorial about typescript, most of you need to know is here



## How to contribute

- Create a topic directory in ```./src``` folder, for example `./src/intersection-type`
- Create a `README.md` for presentation, add code examples (if it's needed) in the same directory



## Tips 

- The topic should be **valuable**, valuable means it really make sense on coding. A topic like ***should we add semicolon in JavaScript*** is not a good topic
- The presentation / explanation about the topic should be **easy** but **sufficient**. If it covers 80% + things we need to know then it's **sufficient**, also if it's understandable by 80% + developers you have ever known then it's **easy**
